# Feature Discovery & Planning

This command helps investigate what's needed for a new feature before implementation.

## Phase 1: Understand the Request

1. Clarify the feature requirements with the user
2. Identify acceptance criteria
3. Determine scope boundaries

## Phase 2: Codebase Analysis

Explore the codebase to understand:

1. **Related existing code**: Find similar features or patterns
2. **Integration points**: Where will this feature connect?
3. **Data models**: What models need to be created/modified?
4. **API endpoints**: What endpoints are needed?
5. **UI components**: What components are affected?

## Phase 3: Impact Assessment

Identify:

1. Files that will be created
2. Files that will be modified
3. Tests that need to be written
4. Documentation that needs updating

## Phase 4: Implementation Plan

Create a plan with:

1. Step-by-step implementation order
2. Dependencies between steps
3. Verification criteria for each step

## Phase 5: User Confirmation

Present the plan to the user for approval before proceeding to implementation.

**Next step**: After planning is approved, use `/create-feature` workflow to implement.
