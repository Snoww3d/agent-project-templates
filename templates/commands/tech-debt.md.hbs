# Tech Debt Discovery & Planning

This command helps plan tech debt resolution before implementation.

## Phase 1: Identify Tech Debt

Options:

1. **From task system**: Run `TaskList` to see tracked tech debt
2. **From docs**: Check `docs/tech-debt.md` for documented issues
3. **User-specified**: User describes a specific issue to address

## Phase 2: Analyze the Issue

For the selected tech debt item:

1. **Current state**: What's wrong with the current implementation?
2. **Desired state**: What should it look like after fixing?
3. **Why it matters**: Performance? Security? Maintainability?
4. **Dependencies**: Does this block or depend on other tasks?

## Phase 3: Scope the Work

Determine:

1. Files to modify
2. Tests to add/update
3. Documentation to update
4. Breaking changes (if any)

## Phase 4: Resolution Plan

Create a plan with:

1. Step-by-step approach
2. Verification criteria
3. Rollback strategy (if risky)

## Phase 5: User Confirmation

Present the plan to the user for approval before proceeding to implementation.

**Next step**: After planning is approved, use `/resolve-tech-debt` workflow to implement.
